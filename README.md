# DictionaryApp

<h3>Description</h3>
This android application made in Android Studio will allow you to look up a word and its associated images from a dictionary API and add it to your own local dictionary. When you have added your words they can be viewed offline and are saved to your device's local storage. You can tap on each word to switch it to your "Inactive Words" list so they will no longer be displayed.
